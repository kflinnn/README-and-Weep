# README-and-Weep

## Purpose

A command-line application that accepts user input to generate a README.

When the user is prompted for information about their application repository, then a high-quality and professional README.md is generated containing the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user enters their project title, it is displayed as the title of the README. When they enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then these are all added to the corresponding sections of the README. After choosing a license from a list of options, a badge for the license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the License section explaining the chosen license for the application. The user then enters their GitHub username and email address to be included in the Questions section along with instructions on how to reach the user. When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents they are taken to the specified section. This was achieved by using node.js and the npm Inquirer.
